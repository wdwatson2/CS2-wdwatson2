a) Using the new operator write the appropriate statement to create a dynamic array of n student instances. 
    Assume n is an integer already defined.

b) What is the return value of the new operator, in the event the computer can not allocate the requested memory. 
    Write a segment of code to check if the new actually succeeded.

c) Dynamic memory means more responsibility for the programmer. 
    Write the appropriate statement to delete the dynamically allocated array you created in part a) of this question.

struct student
	{
		char name[128];
		int age;
		int gender;
		int courseno;
	};

student * parta = new student[n];

if(parta == NULL)
    exit(1);

delete [] parta;
